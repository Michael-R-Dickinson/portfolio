# AWS Microservice Lambda

## Overview

The contact form on the final section of my portfolio site is created through an AWS lambda combined with an API Gateway. It takes an input request with email, password, and name, sending an email to my personal account. The API is simply controlled by `lambda_function.py` preforming the email services through AWS hosting.

Setting up this script in aws can be done through [this](https://github.com/eugenewebdevs/workshops/tree/master/workshops-2019/microservice) tutorial from eugene web devs.

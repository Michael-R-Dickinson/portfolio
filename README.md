# React Portfolio

## About

My personal portfolio project created using create-react-app.
It mostly served as one of my first learning projects in react and with typescript.
In the future I will be updating and rewriting it in various frameworks as I become more comfortable with front end development.

## Contributions

Although this is just a learning proect for me, contributions would be appreciated to help me improve and conform with best practices.
If you'd like to create issues or pull request in changes, dont hesitate to do so.
Criteria for issues is:

-   small.
-   descriptive.
-   testable locally.

To contribute code, follow the fork, edit, pr pipeline.
I may be a bit slow to look at changes so please be patient

## Running Locally

-   Ensure npm is installed locally.
-   Clone the repo to your local device.
-   Run `npm i` to install local package dependencies.
-   Run `npm start` to open a live tab and start hot reloading.
